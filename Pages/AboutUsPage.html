        <h2>Brandon, Founder/Head Adventurer</h2>
        <p>
            Since he could walk Brandon has been enamored with the outdoors. Whenever he could, he spent his time in the
            mountains hiking, climbing, and exploring. As he grew up, he began going on camping trips with his family.
            This eventually lead to a summer as a backpacking guide, giving private tours in the High Uintah
            backcountry. To this day, he'll claim that those 50-mile backpacking trips where some of the best days of
            his life. Since then, he has spent every moment possible camping, canyoneering, climbing, or hiking. He
            started this company to be able to share his love of the outdoors with those that have best experience and
            teach them out to carry out a wilderness expedition correctly. His hope is to help everyone see the natural
            beauty of the outdoors while going on sustainable and eco-friendly trips.

            As well as acting as a Lead Guide for this company, Brandon is a full time student at Utah Valley University where
            he is studying computer science. He also works part time as a Machine Learning Engineer at a software
            company based out of Utah.
