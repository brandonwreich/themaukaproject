        <h2>About Mauka</h2>
        <p>
            Mauka is a Hawaiian word that is often used to describe the direction towards the mountains. The word mauka
            is significant in Hawaiian culture as it represents a connection to the land and the natural world. The
            mountains are considered sacred and the mauka direction is associated with a sense of power and strength.
            The word can also be used metaphorically to mean going back to one's roots or returning to one's original
            source of strength and inspiration. Overall, the word mauka holds great importance in Hawaiian culture as a
            symbol of the deep connection between people and nature.

        <h2>Brandon, Founder/Head Adventurer</h2>
        <p>
            Since he could walk Brandon has been enamored with the outdoors. Whenever he could, he spent his time in the
            mountains hiking, climbing, and exploring. As he grew up, he began going on camping trips with his family.
            This eventually lead to a summer as a backpacking guide, giving private tours in the High Uintah
            backcountry. To this day, he'll claim that those 50-mile backpacking trips where some of the best days of
            his life. Since then, he has spent every moment possible camping, canyoneering, climbing, or hiking. He
            started this company to be able to share his love of the outdoors with those that have best experience and
            teach them out to carry out a wilderness expedition correctly. His hope is to help everyone see the natural
            beauty of the outdoors while going on sustainable and eco-friendly trips.

            As well as acting as a Lead Guide for this company, Brandon is a full time student at Utah Valley University
            where
            he is studying computer science. He also works part time as a Machine Learning Engineer at a software
            company based out of Utah.
