        <h2>Brandon, Founder/Head Adventurer</h2>
        <p>
            Since he could walk Brandon has been enamored with the outdoors. Whenever he could he spent his time in the
            mountains
            hiking, climbing, and exploring. As he grew up, he began going on camping trips with his family. This
            eventually lead
            to a summer as a backpacking guide, giving private tours in the High Uintah Backcountry. To this day, he'll
            claim that
            those 50-mile backpacking trips where some of the best days of his life. Since then, he has spent every
            moment possible
            camping, canyoneering, climbing, or hiking. He started this company to be able to share his love of the
            outdoors with
            those that have best experience and teach them out to carry out a wilderness expedition correctly. His hope
            is to help
            everyone see the natural beauty of the outdoors while going on sustainable and eco-friendly trips.
